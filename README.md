# Horiseon

In this exercise, I replaced the <div> tags with more semantic tags.  I added "alt" attributes to images, and fixed a link from the <nav> bar with an "id".  I added a more descriptive title to the page.  I removed the "header" and "footer" classes and changed the CSS to use the <header> and <footer> tags, reducing redundancy. Cleaned up the CSS and HTML to not use so many classes.
